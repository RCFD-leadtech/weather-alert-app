# working on a  weather alert app
## basic fuctions include an ios and android application that will alert users using the application of severe weather there needs to me a way for *admins* to send push notifications to the users device

 it should show active and past events and include the time date and state and city of the event
 
need to have a seprate page with a passweod that is ***RCFDadmin*** for *admins* to send the alerts out to the users alerts should be viewable by everyone 

need the events that are critical to be *red* urgent to be *yellow* and standerd to be *green*

make the location, time, date, and critical level required fields so it fails if they are blank; if it fails tell the user at the top on a warning banner what fields were missed

make a clear alerts button on the admin page to wipe all past alerts
